This is the demo of todo list by vue3 and gin.

Go is a powerful programming language.

You don't need to write a lot like java, and you can implement
multiple APIs.


# To run demo in localhost

```bash
mkdir <your directory>
cd <your directory>
git clone https://github.com/TimDKChen/todo-vue-gin.git .
cd go-api
go run main.go
cd ../vue-todo
npm install
npm run serve
```

And then, you can see the demo on http://localhost:8080
